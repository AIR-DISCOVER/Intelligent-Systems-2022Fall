The RoboMaster University Sim2Real Challenge (`Sim2Real`) at its core allows participants to win points by
rearranging mineral using fully automated RoboMaster EPs that have been modified officially. 

The match lasts for five minutes with a sim2real-based format, where robots rearrange minerals based on the information shown on the exchange tags to earn points. Participants will be ranked according to their total points won.

The objective of the challenge is to assess how well a program completed on a simulation platform can be operated in real application environments. 

Teams are required to develop and debug their algorithms in a simulator and submit their codes by the specified deadline. The official staff will deploy corresponding codes in physical robots of the same models to earrange minerals. 

Compared to other RoboMaster University events, this challenge does not require teams to build physical robots, allowing participants to focus entirely on algorithm design.
